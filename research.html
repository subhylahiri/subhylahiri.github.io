    <p>
      I perform research in the fields of theoretical neuroscience and
      biophysics, with a focus on learning and memory. I study the relation
      between the structure of biological processes and their performance in
      their functions, particularly models of the processes that implement
      synaptic plasticity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than focusing on specific models, my preferred approach is to
      analyse a broad space of models. In this way, we can find trade-offs
      between different aspects of performance and the properties of models that
      enable the management of these trade-offs. In this way we can understand
      how these structures can be adapted for different purposes in the brain as
      well as artificial neural networks. I believe that this approach is
      necessary to understanding the mechanisms used in the actual biological
      processes and how they may be affected by therapeutic interventions.

  <h3>Complex synaptic plasticity</h3>

    <p>
      Computational neuroscientists often describe synapses by a single number:
      the synaptic weight. Learning is then implemented by shifting this number. In
      contrast, biological synapses are complex systems with their own internal
      dynamics. This structure has profound consequences for their ability to learn
      and store memories, as shown by Amit and Fusi
      (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0954-898X_3_4_008">1992</a> and
      <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/neco.1994.6.5.957">1994</a>).
    </p>

    <p class="project">
      In one project, we analyse the memory timescales of an entire space of
      models of synaptic plasticity, including the cascade model
      (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/10.1016/j.neuron.2005.02.001">2005</a>)
      and others of that class. We find trade-offs between rapid learning and
      slow forgetting and the models that navigate them optimally. This yields
      predictions for the different synaptic structures found in different brain
      regions &ndash; those that store memories for different timescales.

    <p class="project">
      In another project, we investigate genetic/pharmacological interventions
      intended to speed up learning. Experiments with enhanced plasticity have
      shown mixed results &ndash; in some cases learning is enhanced, in others
      it is impaired. We uncover the rules by which such interventions succeed or
      fail. The outcome is determined by both synaptic structure and prior neural
      activity. This provides an explanation for the mixed results of experiments.

  <h3>Energy efficiency of biological processes</h3>

    <p>
      The brain shows amazing energy efficiency, consuming only 20 Watts compared
      to the megawatts consumed by supercomputers. This suggests that minimizing
      energy use may have been an important factor in the evolution of brains.
      The efficient coding theory has provided valuable insight into sensory
      systems, but that field was motivated by the limits set by information
      theory. For energy consumption, we need to know what these limits are.
    </p>

    <p class="project">
      I have been studying the limits on energy efficiency in communication,
      using non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We found a trade-off between the
      energy consumption required to send a signal, the precision with which the
      signal can be decoded and the rate of transmission. In keeping with my
      general approach, this trade-off applies to the entirety of the space of
      models. By taking this further and understanding what principles allow a
      system to approach these limits, we expect to gain insight into how
      biological systems achieve such efficiency, and thus find an important
      design principle. These considerations should also be useful in the design
      of electronic computers etc.

    <p class="project">
      The project above concerned the energy costs of <em>sending</em> a signal.
      In ongoing work we are studying the energy costs of <em>receiving</em> a
      signal. Building on studies of bacterial chemoreception, starting with Berg
      and Purcell (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(77)85544-6">1977</a>),
      we have found a trade-off between energy, accuracy and time required to estimate
      chemical concentration.

  <h3>High dimensional statistics</h3>

    <p class="project">
      One of the perils of high-dimensional data analysis is creating illusions
      of structure in noise. The methods of statistical physics can be used to
      analyse these effects, especially the behaviour of null models.
    </p>
    <ul class="project_links">

    </ul>

    <p class="project">
      One way of alleviating the “curse of dimensionality” is dimensionality
      reduction. As  demonstrated in the field of compressed sensing, random
      dimensionality reduction can be equally effective, without the risk of
      generating illusions of structure. Previous theoretical work on random
      projections has produced very loose bounds on their efficacy, possibly
      because they demand that they apply to arbitrarily ill-conditioned data
      models. In our work, we performed this analysis on an ensemble of random
      manifolds. By focusing on manifolds with high probability we were able to
      produce much tighter bounds.

    </ul>

    <p class="project">
      In another project we applied this line of reasoning to neural recordings.
      Because we usually record a tiny fraction of the neurons of interest
      (typically in the hundreds out of millions/billions), they can be thought
      of as a projection. In this paper, we use random projection ideas to argue
      that, for questions about population dynamics, the onerous task of
      spike-sorting is not necessary.
