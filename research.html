    <p>I perform research in the fields of theoretical neuroscience and
    biophysics, with a focus on learning and memory. I study the relation
    between the structure of biological processes and their performance in
    their functions, paticularly models of the processes that implement
    synaptic plasticity.</p>

    <p>Rather than focusing on specific models, my preferred approach is to
    analyse a broad space of models. In this way, we can find trade-offs
    between different aspects of performance and the properties of models that
    enable the management of these trade-offs. In this way we can understand
    how these structures can be adapted for different purposes in the brain as
    well as artificial neural networks. I believe that this approach is
    necessary to understanding the mechanisms used in the actual biological
    processes and how they may be affected by therapeutic interventions.</p>

  <h3>Complex synaptic plasticity</h3> <p>Computational neuroscientists often
  describe synapses by a single number: the synaptic weight. Learning is then
  implemented by shifting this number. In contrast, biological synapses are
  complex systems with their own internal dynamics. This structure has profound
  consequences for their ability to learn and store memories. We analyse the
  entirety of a broad class of models of synaptic plasticity. We find
  trade-offs between rapid learning and slow forgetting and the models that
  navigate them optimally. This yields predictions for the different synaptic
  structures found in different brain regions. We also investigate
  genetic/pharmacological interventions intended to speed up learning. We
  uncover the rules by which such interventions succeed or fail. The outcome is
  determined by both synaptic structure and prior neural activity. This
  provides an explanation for the mixed results of experiments.</p>
