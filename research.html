    <p>I study the relation between the structure of biological processes and their performance in their functions. The bulk of this work concerns models of mechanisms implementing synaptic plasticity to understand how their structure impacts their capabilities in learning and memory.</p>

    <p>Rather than focusing on specific models, my preferred approach is to analyse a broad space of models. In this way, we can find trade-offs between different aspects of performance and the properties of models that enable the management of these trade-offs. I believe that this approach is necessary to understand how these structures can be adapted to different purposes and flesh out the structureâ€“function relationship.</p>
